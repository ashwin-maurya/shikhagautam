            She is a storyteller, who fell in love with content creation long
            before it became a buzzword. Shikha was one of the first travel
            bloggers in the country, prior to the times of even Instagram and
            Wordpress!

            She forayed into the world of travel, reaching some of the furthest

            more. Like most voracious readers, who turn into even more voracious
            writers, Shikha dribbles between different genres.
